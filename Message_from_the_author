Hi there,

I'm the author of the DeepC2 repository. I'm sorry to disturb you, but I found the 
code unsuitable for being completely open-sourced. It's the implementation of an 
attack method, which contains ethical issues to be open-sourced. I have changed 
the status of the original repository to private. May I ask you to also 
change the forked version to a private one? So much thanks for your cooperation!

Best Regards,
Zhi Wang
